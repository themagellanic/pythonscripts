# pythonscripts
This script is used to send text message to gmail ids of specific domain whose ids have same domains like .nic.in,iiitl.ac.in etc which are stored in a excel sheet along with the information to send them in a particular column.

We can modify it further to send it to any domain also.I have attached screenshot of my excel sheet.
